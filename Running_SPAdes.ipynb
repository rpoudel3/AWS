    "EBS allows us to define one or more storage volumes of almost any size we wish. The hardware details of that storage will be handled for us behind the scenes. EBS volumes exist independently of an EC2 machine and can be moved from one machine to another and the contents can be stored and attached to multiple EC2 instances over time (though only one instance at a time).\n",

    "An AMI or Amazon Machine Instance is a template for launching an instance. The AMI includes a template for a pre-configured root volume that contains an operating system (e.g. Ubuntu Linux, Windows, etc.). The AMI also includes basic configuration of storage volumes that will be available within an instance. You can store a configured machine as an AMI to save your work. There are community AMIs that can be shared.\n",
